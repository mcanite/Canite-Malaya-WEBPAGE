Welcome!

This is my Restoration Project for Section 5 of REL C 225. This repository contains source code for a basic webpage about Joseph Smith's life and works constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Features:
* 4 linked HTML pages
* 1 CSS style sheet
* 1 JavaScript File
* Journaling functionality using your browser's local storage

To view the code and information within each file, consider going into `src > html` and checking out any one of the pages. Note that `index.html` is the "main" page. 

For best viewing, consider running Live Server on Visual Studio Code.
