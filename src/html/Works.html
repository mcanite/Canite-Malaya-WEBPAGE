    <h1>Translating the Book of Mormon</h1>
    <p>Joseph Smith described the process of translating the Book of Mormon as having done so "by the gift and power of God." This process utilized two tools: The "interpreters," also known as the "Urim and Thummim" and a "seer stone." 
    </p>
    <p>The "interpreters" were described as two stones set in a metal frame, while the seer stone was a single stone that Joseph Smith had found and used to find things. Through these instruments, Joseph would be able to translate the Book of Mormon.</p>
    <p>To translate, Joseph Smith would place either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressing his face down to block out the light. From this, he would then relay the English words inspired by the instrument to his scribe, who recorded them.</p>


    <h1>The Doctrine & Covenants</h1>
    <p>The Doctrine & Covenants contain a collection of divine revelations and inspired declarations. Most of its revelations were received by Joseph Smith and for the restoration and establishment of the church on Earth. It is considered another key text in the Church. While the Bible and Book of Mormon are extremely important scriptures, the Doctrine & Covenants is unique due to it including more recent revelations given specifically for the restoration of the Church.</p>
    <p>It is also unique in providing teachings that address contemporary concerns and the unique needs of the restored Church. These revelations were seen as crucial for establishing the Church on Earth, offering specific directions for the organization, beliefs, and practices of the Latter-Day Saints.</p>
