    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>On December 23, 1805, Joseph Smith Jr. was born to Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack in Sharon, Vermont. In 1820, at the young age of fourteen, Joseph Smith entered a forest to seek guidance on which church was true. Praying to ask which church he should join, Joseph Smith was visited by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ who informed him to not join the other existing churches because of their false teachings. This event would be known as the First Vision. Three years later, in 1823, the angel Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith and informed him the location of the Golden Plates. To many, this marked the beginning of Joseph Smith's calling as the Prophet.</p>

    <h1>Adulthood</h1>
    <p>As the Prophet, Joseph Smith was instrumental in restoring the church to the world. In his lifetime, he would go on to translate the Book of Mormon, restore the priesthood, organize the church, and establish temple work. </p>

    <p>One of Joseph's most significant acts was restoring priesthood authority. On May 15, 1829, John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred unto them the lesser priesthood (Aaronic priesthood).</p>

    <p>Joseph also established the first temple in Kirtland, Ohio, and set a precedent for temple work, a core part of church practice today. Temples became sacred spaces where members could gather to seek spiritual guidance, perform holy ordinances, and strengthen their relationship with God. Temple work, begun under Joseph's direction, continues to be a central and defining aspect of the church worldwide.</p>

    <h1>Martyrdom</h1>
    <p>From 1843-1844, tension grew in Nauvoo toward Joseph Smith. Seemingly aware of the danger awaiting him, Joseph Smith entrusted the Twelve Apostles with the keys and authority to lead the Church after him.
    </p>
    <p>On June 27, 1844, an armed mob stormed the Carthage Jail where Joseph Smith, his brother, Hyrum Smith, and other associates, such as Elder John Taylor and Elder Willard Richards were being kept. In this riot, Hyrum Smith was shot first, dying immediately. Meanwhile, Elder Richards and Elder Taylor would go on to survive. Tragically, Joseph Smith would be fatally shot, "sealing his testimony with his blood."</p>
    <p>Though those who stormed the prison hoped that the church would die with Joseph Smith, his work lived on. Today, we enjoy the blessings of having the restored church in the latter days as a direct result of Joseph Smith's resilience, faith, and courage.</p>
